# Models Directory

This directory contains AI/ML models for the Metasploit-AI Framework.

## Model Types
- **Vulnerability Classifier**: TensorFlow models for vulnerability detection
- **Exploit Recommender**: AI models for exploit recommendation and ranking
- **Payload Generator**: Neural networks for intelligent payload generation
- **Risk Analyzer**: Models for security risk assessment and scoring
- **Pattern Recognition**: ML models for network pattern analysis
- **Anomaly Detection**: Models for detecting unusual network behavior
- **Natural Language Processing**: Models for vulnerability description analysis
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Models for automated exploitation strategies

## Model Formats
Supports TensorFlow (.h5), PyTorch (.pt), and ONNX (.onnx) model formats.
Models are automatically downloaded and cached when first used.
Custom models can be trained and stored here for specialized use cases.
