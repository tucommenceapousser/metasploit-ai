### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch
from src.core.scanner import NetworkScanner

class TestNetworkScanner:
    def test_scan_single_host(self):
        """Test scanning a single host."""
        scanner = NetworkScanner()
        result = scanner.scan_host("127.0.0.1", [80, 443])
        
        assert result is not None
        assert "127.0.0.1" in result
        
    @patch('src.core.scanner.nmap')
    def test_scan_with_mocked_nmap(self, mock_nmap):
        """Test scanning with mocked nmap."""
        mock_nmap.PortScanner.return_value.scan.return_value = {}
        
        scanner = NetworkScanner()
        result = scanner.scan_network("192.168.1.0/24")
        
        assert mock_nmap.PortScanner.called
        assert result is not None
```

## üîí Security Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before processing
   - Use parameterized queries for databases

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Implement proper authentication mechanisms
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Secure session management

3. **Encryption**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
   - Use strong cryptographic algorithms
   - Secure key management

4. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Log security-relevant events
   - Avoid logging sensitive information
   - Implement audit trails

### Security Review Process

All security-related changes must:
1. Be reviewed by security team members
2. Include security impact assessment
3. Pass security testing requirements
4. Include documentation updates

## ü§ñ AI/ML Contribution Guidelines

### Model Development

1. **Data Requirements**
   - Use only publicly available vulnerability data
   - Ensure data privacy and compliance
   - Document data sources and licensing

2. **Model Training**
   - Use reproducible training pipelines
   - Implement proper validation techniques
   - Document model architecture and parameters

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
   - Measure inference time and resource usage
   - Compare against baseline models

4. **Ethical Considerations**
   - Avoid biased training data
   - Consider fairness and transparency
   - Document potential misuse scenarios

### AI Code Examples

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

class VulnerabilityClassifier:
    """AI model for vulnerability classification."""
    
    def __init__(self, model_path=None):
        """Initialize the classifier."""
        self.model = None
        if model_path:
            self.load_model(model_path)
    
    def train(self, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val):
        """Train the classification model."""
        # Model architecture
        self.model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.3),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(len(np.unique(y_train)), activation='softmax')
        ])
        
        # Compile model
        self.model.compile(
            optimizer='adam',
            loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
            metrics=['accuracy']
        )
        
        # Train model
        history = self.model.fit(
            X_train, y_train,
            validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
            epochs=100,
            batch_size=32,
            verbose=1
        )
        
        return history
    
    def predict(self, X):
        """Make predictions on new data."""
        if self.model is None:
            raise ValueError("Model not trained or loaded")
        
        return self.model.predict(X)
```

## üìä Performance Guidelines

### Optimization Requirements

1. **Response Time**
   - Web interface: < 2 seconds for most operations
   - CLI commands: < 5 seconds for complex operations
   - AI inference: < 1 second for single predictions

2. **Resource Usage**
   - Memory: Efficient memory management
   - CPU: Utilize multi-threading where appropriate
   - Disk: Implement caching for frequently accessed data

3. **Scalability**
   - Support concurrent users/operations
   - Implement connection pooling for databases
   - Use async programming patterns

### Performance Testing

```python
import time
import concurrent.futures
from src.core.framework import MetasploitAIFramework

def performance_test_concurrent_scans():
    """Test framework performance with concurrent scans."""
    framework = MetasploitAIFramework()
    
    def run_scan(target):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = framework.run_scan(target)
        end_time = time.time()
        return end_time - start_time
    
    targets = ["192.168.1.1", "192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.3"]
    
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=3) as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(run_scan, targets))
    
    avg_time = sum(results) / len(results)
    assert avg_time < 30  # Should complete within 30 seconds
```

## üìù Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

               - exploitability: Exploitability score (float)
               - recommendations: List of remediation recommendations (List[str])
       
       Raises:
           ValueError: If vuln_data is missing required fields
           ModelNotLoadedError: If AI models are not properly loaded
       
       Example:
           >>> analyzer = VulnerabilityAnalyzer()
           >>> vuln_data = {
           ...     'cve_id': 'CVE-2021-1234',
           ...     'description': 'Buffer overflow in service X',
           ...     'affected_systems': ['Windows 10', 'Windows Server 2019']
           ... }
           >>> analysis = analyzer.analyze_vulnerability(vuln_data)
           >>> print(analysis.severity)
           'HIGH'
       """
   ```

2. **Comments**
